# FAQ
## Why?
> Games always destroy my ears and a game i play doesn't like AutoHotkey so i remade my script into an application.

## I want it
> Ride side, click Releases. I recomend autostarting it via Task Scheduler as adminstrator (if you dont know how, google something like "windows task scheduler autostart app as admin" or similar) so it always works. If not running as admin, it cant mute apps running as admin because security™️. If you dont care, dropping a shortcut to the exe in `shell:startup` will work just as well.

## I wanna change the keybind
> You need to recompile it yourself, i'm not gonna implement anything.

## Do i need anything
> Net8, chances are it'll redirect you to the download on start if you dont have it
